  # Local backend: state lives on disk under ./state/<env>.tfstate. The path is
  # supplied per env at init time so each env keeps its own state file:
  #   terraform init -backend-config=backends/<env>.hcl
  # Local state is simple and great for learning or a solo demo. For a real
  # team, switch this to `backend "s3" {}` so state is shared and locked.
